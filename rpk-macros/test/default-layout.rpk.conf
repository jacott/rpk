# ============================
[matrix:3x3]
# Names for row,colum and default main layer key code. Codes can be pseudo code like u1 or k24 which
# will map to noop by default.

# 0x00 means start assigning from row 0, column 0. 0x5a would mean start from row 5, column 10. If
# there are more than 16 rows or columns you can use 4 hex digits like, say; 0x1234 for row 18,
# column 52. A maxiumum of 127 rows and columns is allowed.
